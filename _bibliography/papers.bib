As an application, we obtain a new analytic stability criterion for the existence of a Kähler-Einstein metric on a Fano manifold in terms of the Ricci flow and the distance function.

	shorttitle = {Bicycle},
	abstract = {While a growing number of algorithms for causal discovery of directed acyclic graphs from observational and interventional data have been proposed, the robust identification of cyclic causal graphs in particular remains an open problem. Solutions to this challenge would have a considerable impact in various application domains, including single-cell genomics, where gene regulatory networks are known to contain feedback loops. Recent work has shown promise to address this challenge by describing the expression states in a population of cells as the steady-state solution of a stochastic dynamical system. However, this formulation cannot account for information on interventions in the population, and consequently, it ignores the associated causal inductive biases, which are key assets to obtain meaningful results and improve identifiability. In this work, we propose a novel method, Bicycle, which (i) infers cyclic causal relationships from i.i.d. data, (ii) explicitly accounts for information on the perturbation state of cells by a realization of the independent causal mechanism principle and (iii) models causal effects in a latent space rather than on observed data. We benchmark Bicycle in the context of existing approaches, demonstrating improved recovery of simulated causal graphs and improved out-of-distribution prediction performance on unseen perturbations in real single-cell datasets.},

            Rare genetic variants can have strong effects on phenotypes, yet accounting for rare variants in genetic analyses is statistically challenging due to the limited number of allele carriers and the burden of multiple testing. While rich variant annotations promise to enable well-powered rare variant association tests, methods integrating variant annotations in a data-driven manner are lacking. Here we propose deep rare variant association testing ({DeepRVAT}), a model based on set neural networks that learns a trait-agnostic gene impairment score from rare variant annotations and phenotypes, enabling both gene discovery and trait prediction. On 34 quantitative and 63 binary traits, using whole-exome-sequencing data from {UK} Biobank, we find that {DeepRVAT} yields substantial gains in gene discoveries and improved detection of individuals at high genetic risk. Finally, we demonstrate how {DeepRVAT} enables calibrated and computationally efficient rare variant tests at biobank scale, aiding the discovery of genetic risk factors for human disease traits.},

            {RNA} velocity exploits the temporal information contained in spliced and unspliced {RNA} counts to infer transcriptional dynamics. Existing velocity models often rely on coarse biophysical simplifications or numerical approximations to solve the underlying ordinary differential equations ({ODEs}), which can compromise accuracy in challenging settings, such as complex or weak transcription rate changes across cellular trajectories. Here we present cell2fate, a formulation of {RNA} velocity based on a linearization of the velocity {ODE}, which allows solving a biophysically more accurate model in a fully Bayesian fashion. As a result, cell2fate decomposes the {RNA} velocity solutions into modules, providing a biophysical connection between {RNA} velocity and statistical dimensionality reduction. We comprehensively benchmark cell2fate in real-world settings, demonstrating enhanced interpretability and power to reconstruct complex dynamics and weak dynamical signals in rare and mature cell types. Finally, we apply cell2fate to the developing human brain, where we spatially map {RNA} velocity modules onto the tissue architecture, connecting the spatial organization of tissues with temporal dynamics of transcription.},

            Genomic language models ({gLMs}) have emerged as a powerful approach for learning genome-wide functional constraints directly from {DNA} sequences. However, standard {gLMs} adapted from natural language processing often require extremely large model sizes and computational resources, yet still fall short of classical evolutionary models in predictive tasks. Here, we introduce {GPN}-Star (Genomic Pretrained Network with Species Tree and Alignment Representation), a biologically grounded {gLM} featuring a phylogeny-aware architecture that leverages whole-genome alignments and species trees to model evolutionary relationships explicitly. Trained on alignments spanning vertebrate, mammalian, and primate evolutionary timescales, {GPN}-Star achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of variant effect prediction tasks in both coding and non-coding regions of the human genome. Analyses across timescales reveal task-dependent advantages of modeling more recent versus deeper evolution. To demonstrate its potential to advance human genetics, we show that {GPN}-Star substantially outperforms prior methods in prioritizing pathogenic and fine-mapped {GWAS} variants; yields unprecedented enrichments of complex trait heritability; and improves power in rare variant association testing. Extending beyond humans, we train {GPN}-Star for five model organisms –
            Mus musculus, Gallus gallus, Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans
            , and
            Arabidopsis thaliana
            – demonstrating the robustness and generalizability of the framework. Taken together, these results position {GPN}-Star as a scalable, powerful, and flexible new tool for genome interpretation, well suited to leverage the growing abundance of comparative genomics data.},
